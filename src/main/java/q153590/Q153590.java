/*
 *I have a script that alphabetizes the layers in adobe illustrator. It does so by sorting the layers in an array (using string names) and then using that to change the item order position (zOrder) of the layers. The script runs fine, however if there is a very large layer (which I deal with a lot) of over 8000+ it gets very sluggish and slow (over 10 minutes to sort). I would like a way to optimize the code to run faster, possibly a faster sort or search algorithm (it searches the array at one point which is the main source of the problem). *The main problem is the 'search' function. I need to search the array and can't use indexOf (which is much slower anyways). *I'm primarily a java programmer and could figure this out in java, i'm fairly new to javascript so am unsure how to go about optimizing my search/sort functions. Also most questions and answers are in the browser with javascript, any help is appreciated. */
